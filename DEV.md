Implementation details of the thing


# NC vs C
The difference is how the linear combinations combine.


# Ring hom

* sseq has an free module implementation with iamges

I guess the the trick is that like you decompose the tree until you read the leaf at which point you 

* free module
    * has a basis/generator

* ring hom implementation

m2 has a matrix

* how about instead of expresison I have a linear combination?

Maybe I can use a bitset for the 

* free module
    * is this the same as representable in haskell?


* maybe i dont need an expression but a linear combination


* no i probably need an expresison

the trick heere is that 


# mpoly

* what will happen if i keep the terms around and just multiply it 
* look at symbolica
