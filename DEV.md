Implementation details of the thing


# NC vs C
The difference is how the linear combinations combine.


# Ring hom



I guess the the trick is that like you decompose the tree until you read the leaf at which point you 

* free module
    * has a basis/generator

* ring hom implementation

has a matrix

* how about instead of expresison I have a linear combination?

Maybe I can use a bitset for the 

* free module
    * is this the same as representable in haskell?


* maybe i dont need an expression but a linear combination


* no i probably need an expresison

the trick heere is that
